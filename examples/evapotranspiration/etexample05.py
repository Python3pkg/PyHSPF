# this example shows how to use the ETCalculator class to convert hourly 
# reference evapotranspiration to hourly potential evapotranspiration using
# crop coefficients consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organization.
# the first part is really the same as the previous examples, with the 
# differences coming at the end. the script consists of five parts: 
#
#    1. download and aggregate climate data
#    2. get areal-weighted average latitude, longitude, and elevation
#    3. calculate hourly reference evapotranspiration
#    4. convert reference evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration 
#    5. aggregate hourly estimates and plot results

# HSPF requires potential evapotranspiration (PET) whereas the reference 
# evapotranspiration (RET) calculated with the Penman-Monteith Equation is the 
# PET for well-watered grass. RET may be an appropriate PET value for an HSPF
# model, although the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides a
# method to extend RET to PET using crop coefficients. The ratio of the PET to 
# the RET is called the crop coefficient and varies throughout the growing 
# season as the plants increase their leaf area index. For example, corn in 
# the Midwestern USA is planted in April and begins with no leaves (or 
# associated transpiration) and is then harvested in the Fall when it has lots 
# of leaves and associated PET. The FAO method divides the crop lifecycle 
# into several phases:
#
#  1. winter to planting
#  2. planting to emergence
#  3. emergence to mid-season (growth phase)
#  4. full growth period
#  5. late growth period to harvest
#  6. harvest to end of year
#
# The daily crop coefficient for a given crop throughout the year can be 
# reduced to the following variables:
#
# plant date
# time to emergence   (step 2 above)
# time to full growth (step 3 above)
# time at full growth (step 4 above)
# late growth time    (step 5 above)
# the crop coefficient for bare soil (no vegetation state)
# the crop coefficient at full growth
# the crop coefficient at harvest
#
# the crop coefficient for a given day can be inferred by constructing a 
# linear function from the bare soil state to full growth state across the 
# growth period, and then from the end of the full growth to the harvest date.
# the FAO has a publication that describes this in detail and includes a 
# number of literature values for the parameters for different crops and
# other kinds of vegetation.
#
# The ETCalculator can be used to calculate hourly PET timeseries for crops
# using the FAO method. First, the parameters for a given crop must be provided.
# Corn in the Midwestern USA is planted around April 15 and has approximately
# a 30-day period to emergence, a 50-day growth phase, a 60-day time at full
# growth, and another 40 days until harvest. Literature crop coefficients
# are 0.3 for bare soil, 1.15 for the full growth period, and a harvest 
# coefficient of 0.40 (consistent with FAO guidance for "cereals"). First the
# parameters should be added to the calculator.
