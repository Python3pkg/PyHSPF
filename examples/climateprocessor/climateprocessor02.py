# illustrates how to use the ClimateProcessor class to download data from
# various online databases and then aggregate the time series using some 
# numpy features. The first part is the essentially the same as the previous 
# example, so there is minimal discussion.

# download the data; this step will be skipped if this has already been done
# (from the last example) but is necessary to set the metadata

processor.download(bbox, start, end, output, datasets = ['GHCND'])

# let's use GHCND to work with temperature data. let's use the metadata to 
# find the 10 stations with the longest temperature records and then aggregate 
# the data together to get a mean time series across the period of interest.

# get the data and store it in a numpy array. this gets computationally 
# expensive so it's wise to take advantage of these built-in modules.

    # make the time series and fill it in--one thing to note is that this 
    # method includes Nones if data are missing--this is really critical and
    # can be a huge pain since a complete, continuous time series is needed
    # to run simulations

# let's transpose to switch the ordering from stations to days

# let's take advantage of numpy to analyze the data. the following lines show
# how to look for nan (missing values) using a "mask" to find the NoneTypes

nones = numpy.isnan(tmax)

# this example was made simply to show one way to work with the data--PyHSPF
# has built-in methods to do the aggregation steps above more simply. however, 
# because there are an infinite number of possible ways to aggregate the 
# climate data for HSPF, the idea is to create a development environment for
# new tools. In the past, HSPF has typically been run with data from a single 
# station, but there is really no need for this limitation. in general, the 
# temperature values are not so critical for HSPF, so the most logical 
# approach appears to be averaging the datasets together to account for 
# spatial variability, missing data, reporting errors, etc.
