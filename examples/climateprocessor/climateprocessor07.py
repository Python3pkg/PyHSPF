# this example illustrates how to use the ClimateProcessor class to aggregate 
# raw precipitation data into subbasin-specific time series using an inverse 
# distance weighted average. makes use of the "subbasin_catchments" shapefile
# in this directory that was generated using the NHDPlusExtractor and 
# HUC8Delineator classes shown elsewhere.

# of the precipitation stations from the centroid of each subbasin. the file

# catchments for the Patuxent watershed (HUC 02060006). each shape is a 
# catchment subbasin with a Common Identifier (ComID) feature attribute that 
# corresponds to the NHDPlus ComID for the subbasin reach outlet, a CenX 
# feature attribute representing the longitude of the centroid, and a CenY
# feature attribute representing the latitude of the centroid. let's open the
