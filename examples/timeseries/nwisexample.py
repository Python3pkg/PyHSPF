# This example illustrates how to extract NWIS data for HSPF using the 
# NWISExtractor class. The extractor will download the source shapefile that
# has the metadata for the daily discharge and water quality data for the
# entire USA. If the source file already exists it will skip this step. 
# The example shows how to download all the data for a given HUC8, starting
# by extracting a point shapefile for the HUC8 then downloading the daily
# discharge and water quality data using the GageStation class (you can view
# the class in the preprocessing directory). The example then shows how 
# to download data for just one station as an alternative. Finally, the example
# shows how to open and work with the data for each gage in the watershed.
