# illustrates how to download data from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL),
# extract a Geotiff for a HUC8 from the source, and calculate the landuse
# data for each polygon in the shapefile. Example utilizes the subbasin 
# shapefile for the Patuxent River Watershed (HUC 02060006), in Maryland.

# dictionaries as follows:
#
# the keys to the first dictionary level are the field values for the 
# 'FEATUREID' attribute (or whatever field from the shapefile is supplied)
#
# the keys to the second level dictionary are the unique values of the landuse
# specified in "aggregate" (data/patuxent/cdlaggregation.csv)
#
# to understand how this works, it's a good idea to spend some time looking at 
# the aggregate file and CDL rasters and the output; there are 255 unique codes
# in the CDL that are mapped into 10 categories in this example

# the processing can be visualized using the plot_landuse method. the 
# "datatype" keyword of 'raw' or 'results' can be used to see the aggregated
# values before and a "band chart" where the area of the stripes corresponds
# to the area of the land use fraction (this is how HSPF "thinks" about landuse)
