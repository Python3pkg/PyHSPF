# This example illustrates how to break up an 8-digit HUC watershed into 
# subwatersheds that have outlets co-located with dams and flowgages and 
# a maximal drainage area using the PyHSPF HUC8Delineator class. The source
# data files come from NHDPlus V2, NWIS, and the NID as shown in previous
# examples. The catchments and flowlines from NHDPlus are aggregated together
# to satisfy the criteria for the delineation. If you have already downloaded 
# the source data files from NHDPlus, NWIS, and NID, make sure to point
# to the file paths otherwise they will be downloaded automatically (which
# takes a while). The idea is to automate the construction of the data files 
# needed to make the "Watershed" object for PyHSPF.

# argument to the delineate method if there are other points of interest 
# in the HUC8 where you want to place subbasin outlets (besides dams and gages).
