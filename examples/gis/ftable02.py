# shows how to use the FtableCalculator and the NHDPlus Flowline Value Added
# attributes to extend Ftable estimates from a gage station to other reaches 
# upstream in a watershed. the first part is similar to the previous ftable
# example, but the remainder shows the extension using the NHDPlus data.
